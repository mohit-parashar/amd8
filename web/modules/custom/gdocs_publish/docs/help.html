<p>If publishing to Drupal causes problems, please follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't have the &quot;Publish to Drupal&quot; menu item under add-ons, you probably don't have the add-on installed. Please <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drupalpublish/hgmlneddbkcoopmibclacpfkobaepobj">install the add-on</a> here.</li>
<li>If you get the error <b>&quot;Add-on not found&quot;</b> after installation, sign out of all your Google accounts (choose &quot;Sign Out&quot; from the menu on top right under your avatar icon), and then sign back in only to your America account. Then reinstall the add-on.</li>
<li>If you get the error <b>&quot;You do not have permission to create content in this format&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;Cannot create a node of type ___&quot;</b> when trying to publish, check that your Drupal host name is set probperly. If it is, and you still get the error, you probably have an old version of the add-on.
<li>If you get an error in Google Documents when installing or using the add-on, review your document to see if there is any unusual formatting or other items that may be causing trouble. Remove them and try again.</li>
<li>If you get an error in Drupal after publishing a document, please screenshot the error and let us know what document you were publishing from. Send it to <a href="mailto:sawyer@americamedia.org">Sam</a> and <a href="mailto:ken@harmoni.ca">Ken</a>.</li>
</ul>
